	<h3 style="position: relative;text-align: center;">The world's most popular youtube blogger PewDiePie has become a streamer on Youtube Gaming</h3>
	<p style="position: relative;text-align: center;">Felix 'PewDiePie' Chelberg-signed an exclusive contract to conduct streams on the Youtube Gaming platform. In principle, it seems that the news was voiced by "Captain obvious". The most popular blogger from youtube started streaming on youtube gaming. On this note, you can already move on to another article. However, I want to point out other important points that "flow" from this news.

Bloggers become a streamer?

The fact is that streaming as an activity is more interactive in itself, and over time (with the growing quality of the Internet), streamers will displace bloggers because they are more interactive. They are closer to the public, they are broadcasting right now. I will never forget how during the broadcast of "Dota 2 Major" a guy and a girl sat at the next table in a coffee shop (they clearly had a date) and watched the broadcast. Can you imagine him watching a video recorded a couple of days ago? No, there's no need, and it makes sense to watch the live stream right now, whether you're on a date or somewhere else.

Is PewDiePie late with streaming?

Felix 'PewDiePie' Chelberg is not by chance the world's most popular youtube blogger, as a leader, he looked at trends and did not climb the first into the unknown expanses of streaming. The market has been defined, trends are clear, and the sharks of blogging are now floating smoothly towards Twitch, YouTube gaming, mixer and Facebook gaming. How do you think who will win this battle, or is it more correct to ask: can someone move Twitch off Its pedestal?

Has PewDiePie streamed before?

Felix has already made one attempt to try on the" skin " of the streamer. He signed a contract with the dlive platform in April 2019, however, quickly curtailed his streams on not the most popular platform. Well, we wish Telugu success in scremerston.

How much did an exclusive contract with PewDiePie cost for Youtube?

Mixer is rumored to have paid the world's most popular streamer, Ninja, more than $ 70,000,000 for a 10-year contract. Let's assume that the numbers of the contract with PewDiePie should not be less..</p>
